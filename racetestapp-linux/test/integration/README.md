# Integration Test App

This test application handles integration testing of the `racetestapp`. Integration tests include, but are not limited to:
* tests that involve multiple productions components (e.g. two classes interacting with each other)
* tests that involve I/O (e.g file or network)
* tests that take a long time to run (e.g. longer than 100ms)
